## ❓ How it works
The user is asked to enter characters that the programme can use (symbols, numbers and letters), for example, "1234567890", "+</?*" or "abcdeABCDE".
The user enters the password he/she wants to solve.
The programme starts decoding and tries to try the password by generating random characters at each step.
When the password is found, the programme terminates and reports how many steps it has taken. 

## 🧾 Considerations
This application only tries to crack the password you have entered. Not illegal!
